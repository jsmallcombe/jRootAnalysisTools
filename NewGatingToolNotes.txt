------------------

Rename ThreeDee integer to dimensionalioty / Ndim etc 

Write a 3dim THnSparse generating function

Th3 should have a 2 panel option, probably dividing into a main window class and a frame isn't needed for >2D

The projections methods currently set to overflow off should have 4 options for 4 flow modes, global setting, local override
Write an explanation of this for the manual

Set backfracfrac to be an ajustable global parameter

What happened to the TH3 popup?

------------------

Check overflow is currently working with our set range options :

TH3::Project3D
NOTE 4: underflow/overflow are included by default in the projection To exclude underflow and/or overflow (for both axis in case of a projection to a 1D histogram) use option "NUF" and/or "NOF" With SetRange() you can have all bins except underflow/overflow only if you set the axis bit range as following after having called SetRange: axis->SetRange(1, axis->GetNbins());

Updated the header notes

Make THSparse gatting tool

Make A 2D OR 3D sensing gating wrapper class

Reintrioduce the adjustable width from old class
Maybe important :
        gJframe1->ChangeOptions(kFixedWidth);
        Connect("ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)","jgating_tool", this,"ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)");
Overriding the Layout command seems to be a better way
        
The rebinning of the gating select frame has a glitch (common to old code).
when rebinning the selection jumps to the old bin number, now wrong.
Similar behaviour error on change project or updated input?
Review and fix

Connect new gating tools to jEnv, depreiciate the old ones from the codebase.
Update the readme to use the updated class names
