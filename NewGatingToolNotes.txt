It seems the old vs new tools have stopped agreeing, was this the result of an overflow setting or the templating changes?


We dont know if sumw2 is done proprly in THnBase version ....
THnBase has no error errors

Currently the removal of sumw2 for certain background subtractions is off due templating conflict, but these were for a reason
This needs fixing possibly by de-templating

------------------

Add globals:
backfracfrac
TH3head

Write an explanation of the globals for Overflow Underflow in the manual

What happened to the TH3 popup? (they are disabled by a return nullptr at the start, why? check/fix)

------------------

Updated the header notes on all files

------------------

Make a wrapper class to call the correct gating tool of the many avaialble.
Can fold the text input into that.

Add THn to the jEnv browser


Reintrioduce the adjustable width from old class
Maybe important :
        gJframe1->ChangeOptions(kFixedWidth);
        Connect("ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)","jgating_tool", this,"ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)");
Overriding the Layout command seems to be a better way
        
The rebinning of the gating select frame has a glitch (common to old code).
when rebinning the selection jumps to the old bin number, now wrong.
Similar behaviour error on change project or updated input?
Review and fix

Connect new gating tools to jEnv, depreiciate the old ones from the codebase.
Update the readme to use the updated class names
