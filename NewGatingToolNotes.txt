Hidden Elements in frames i.e. Manual background slider, Save panel etc
are made visible when a parent frame calls some mapping/resizing commands, so these need to be manually hidden again at the top level.

///////////////////

Result frame:
j_gating_result_frame

Inputs:
TH1** - inputs for results, pre-subtraction gated and projection (pointers should be kept valid at parent level)
double* - for gate centroid 

Emits:
"RequestTwoDee(Bool_t)"   only possible when set for 3D
        Update the TH1**/double* to the parent-parent and then call InputUpdated()

Notes:
When parent frame changes projection, or its input, call InputUpdated(TH1*)
When gating finished, call regular draw command; DrawHist()
Call HideSave() after parent frame initilises the first time.

///////////////////

Result frame:
j_gating_select_frame

Inputs:
TH1* - The gate-side projection of the matrix

Emits:
"OutputReady()"     use functions to fetch bin numbers and do the gating
"RequestProjection(Int_t)"   change the projection and then UpdateInput(TH1*)
     
Notes:
When parent frame changes projection, or its input, call UpdateInput(TH1*) 


///////////////////
2D Gating frame
Children: j_gating_select_frame & j_gating_result_frame

Write for 2D only to begin with, then add the "for3D passing" afterward

NOTE:
The gating functions for 2D->1D fill histograms with the same name without deleting,
It is slightly faster, so the names should be set by itterator only at class instance initilisation, NOT every call of gating function.

NOTE:
When calling  InputUpdated(TH1*) calls for select frame, block the recieving function for Emits:"OutputReady()" to avoid double DrawHist() calls to result frame, instead a call of InputUpdated() will be made to result frame, which itself calls the DrawHist().

Move static interator and interator-function to this class and move links in children classes

Update the readme to use the updated class name
