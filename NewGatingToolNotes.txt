Updated the header notes

Make THSparse gatting tool

Make A 2D OR 3D sensing gating wrapper class

Reintrioduce the adjustable width from old class
Maybe important :
        gJframe1->ChangeOptions(kFixedWidth);
        Connect("ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)","jgating_tool", this,"ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)");
Overriding the Layout command seems to be a better way
        
The rebinning of the gating select frame has a glitch (common to old code).
when rebinning the selection jumps to the old bin number, now wrong.
Similar behaviour error on change project or updated input?
Review and fix

Connect new gating tools to jEnv, depreiciate the old ones from the codebase.
Update the readme to use the updated class names


------------------



Rename ThreeDee integer to dimensionalioty / Ndim etc 

Test the re-used names are working with TH3 using the pointer checks (after implementing TH3)

Backmode change function doesnt pass, should it?

Remove "suffix" from TH2/TH3

Write a 3dim THnSparse generating function


Th3 should have a 2 panel option, probably dividing into a main window class and a frame isn't needed for >2D

The projections methods currently set to overflow off should have 4 options for 4 flow modes, global setting, local override
Write an explanation of this for the manual

Set backfracfrac to be an ajustable global parameter
