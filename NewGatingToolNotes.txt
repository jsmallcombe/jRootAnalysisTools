Updated the header notes

Make THSparse gatting tool

Make A 2D OR 3D gating wrapper class

Reintrioduce the adjustable width from old class
Maybe important :
        gJframe1->ChangeOptions(kFixedWidth);
        Connect("ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)","jgating_tool", this,"ProcessedConfigure(Event_t*)");
Overriding the Layout command seems to be a better way
        
The rebinning of the gating select frame has a glitch (common to old code).
when rebinning the selection jumps to the old bin number, now wrong.
Similar behaviour error on change project or updated input?
Review and fix

Connect new gating tools to jEnv, depreiciate the old ones from the codebase.
Update the readme to use the updated class names
