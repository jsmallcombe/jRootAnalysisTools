-UltraFitEnv
A graphical enviroment to manage the fitting and saving of fit results for TH1 histograms. A full helpfile is included in the tool.
-jEnv

Various histogram presentation formating and automated fitting (for peaks and efficiency curves) macros are also included and may be documented later
